# platemo-modcell
A PlatEMO fork to use with ModCell strain design software

The version corresponds to PlatEMO v1.3 (2017-9), which was downloaded from http://bimk.ahu.edu.cn/index.php?s=/Index/Software/index.html

# Features

- Compatibility with [modcell](https://github.com/trinhlab/modcell2/)
- Added termination criteria
- Added parallelization
- Allow to discard older solutions to avoid memory hogging issues.

# Why not fork from PlatEMO github or newer version?
PlatEMO now has a [github repo](https://github.com/BIMK/PlatEMO) however this was not the case with earlier versions.
 and the current version (2.0) has undergone major refactoring 
which breaks compatibility with the ModCell modifications.
